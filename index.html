                        <p>This article follows a question I was asked... And a lack of enough different solutions made me think about the subject again and again, until I decided to dig a little bit more about it.  </p>

                    <p>
                            After various discussions, I came to the conclusion that I had to present the fruit of my work learning HTML, CSS and (a little of) javascript.
                            Many work remains to be done, and probably the solutions adopted are not the most DRY (do not repeat yourself), but I think that will come with practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through these few pages, which I hope will tend to expand, you can find all kinds of ramblings whose sole purpose are to give me the material to be able to practice. The subject is therefore only an excuse.</p>                 
                    <p>I wish you a warm welcome!</p>

                    <p>In this article, we discover how to install OpenSSH on Windows 10, which until recently was the pick up compared to Linux and MacOS.</p>
                    <p>We also take the opportunity to quickly digress on asymmetric and symmetric encryption, since it is the backbone of SSH connection.</p>
