                    <h2>How to install OpenSSH on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p> 
                        This document has two distinct purposes:
                        <ol>
                            <li>In an indirect way, allow me to refine and put into practice my skills in web programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).</li>
                            <li>And, in this case, allow the reader to use SSh on Windows 10 without having to go through third-party applications 
                                such as <a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank">PuTTY</a>.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is written in parallel with my learning of web technologies, which I realize using a number of tutorials and tutorials, 
                        including those from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web" target="_blank">Mozilla.org</a>.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>The Secure SHell (SSH) protocol allows a remote and secure connection to a server. Until very recently, Windows users had to
                        go through a third-party application like PuTTY to establish an SSH connection, unlike users of MacOS or Linux, which could
                        launch it directly from the command line.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Exchanges encryption with SSH</h3>
                    <p>
                        Without going into the details of encryption algorithms, which is not the subject here, we will talk about two major categories:
                        ciphers <em>symmetric</em> and <em>asymmetric</em>. I recommend reading the following 
                        <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/courses/reprenez-le-controle-a-l-aide-de-linux/la-connexion-securisee-a-distance-avec-ssh" target="_blank">tutorial</a> 
                        (in french), from which these paragraphs are largely inspired.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Symmetric encryption</h4>
                    <P>Symmetric encryption is the simplest method of encryption. With this method, the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message.
                        It is therefore necessary that the person who encrypts and the one who decrypts both know the key.
                    </P>
                    <p>The difficulty of this scheme is to find a way to exchange the key. It cannot be exchanged in clear, because a person intercepting the key could
                        then decipher all the following messages. The solution to work around this dead end is to encrypt the encryption key when it is sent. 
                        Then we come to the method of asymmetric encryption.</p>
                    <h4>Asymmetric encryption</h4>
                    <P>Asymmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and another to decrypt.</P>
                    <P>There are two keys:</P>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A "<strong>public</strong>" key used to <strong>encrypt the message.</strong></li>
                        <li>A "<strong>private</strong>" key used to <strong>decrypt the message.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The public key is only used to encrypt. With this type of algorithm, we can decipher a message only if we know the private key.</p>
                    <p>
                        At first, the computer is asked to generate a pair of keys: one private and one public.
                        The public key is sent to the other machine wishing to communicate with the computer, so that it can encrypt its messages using the public key. 
                        The private key is kept secret by the computer to be able to decipher all the encrypted messages with the public key that it will receive 
                        from the other computer.
                    </p>
                    <P>So we say that this encryption is asymmetrical because you need two different keys. One encrypts the message, another decrypts it.</P>
                    <P>The public key can be transmitted in clear on the network. It does not matter if a hacker intercepts it, since it only serves to encrypt (not decrypt). 
                        On the other hand the private key that makes it possible to decipher must remain secret.
                    </P>
                    <p>The best-known asymmetric encryption algorithm is called RSA (for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, from the names of its three inventors).</p>
                
                    <h4>In the case of SSH</h4>
                    <P>
                        SSH uses both ciphers: asymmetrical and symmetric. It works in this order:
                    </P>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The two machines wishing to communicate first use asymmetric encryption to exchange a symmetric encryption key.</li>
                        <li>For all the following exchanges, the symmetric encryption is used.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <P><strong>Asymmetric encryption is used only at the beginning of the communication</strong>, so that the machines can exchange in a secure way 
                        the symmetric encryption key.
                        <br>
                        This double encryption method is used because asymmetric encryption has a flaw: it requires far too much resources from the processor. 
                        Asymmetric encryption is 100 to 1000 times slower than symmetric encryption.
                    </P>
                    <P>To summarize, we have the following procedure:</P>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The first machine generates a public key and a private key (asymmetric encryption).</li>
                        <li>The public key is sent to the other machine.</li>
                        <li>This other machine generates a symmetric key, encrypts it with the public key received and sends it to the first machine.</li>
                        <li>The first machine decrypts the message with its private key and thus obtains the symmetric encryption key.</li>
                        <li>All subsequent exchanges between the two machines are done using the symmetric key encryption they both have.</li>
                    </ol>
